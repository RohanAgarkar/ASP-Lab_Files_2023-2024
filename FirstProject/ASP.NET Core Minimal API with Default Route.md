 **ASP.NET Core Minimal API with Default Route**

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/", () => "");

app.Run();
```


This is a simple ASP.NET Core Minimal API with a default route. It uses the `WebApplicationBuilder` class to create a web application builder, and then uses the `Build()` method to create the web application.

The `MapGet()` method is used to map a GET request to the root URL ("/") to a lambda expression that returns an empty string. This means that when a client makes a GET request to the root URL, the server will respond with an empty string.

The `Run()` method is used to start the web application.

**Code Snippets**

The following code snippets show the key parts of the code:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
```

This line creates a web application builder. The `CreateBuilder()` method takes an array of strings as an argument, which represents the command-line arguments passed to the application.

```csharp
var app = builder.Build();
```

This line builds the web application. The `Build()` method returns a `WebApplication` object, which represents the web application.

```csharp
app.MapGet("/", () => "");
```

This line maps a GET request to the root URL ("/") to a lambda expression that returns an empty string. The `MapGet()` method takes two arguments: the URL pattern and a lambda expression that represents the handler for the request.

```csharp
app.Run();
```

This line starts the web application. The `Run()` method starts the web application and listens for incoming requests.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**

The following steps explain how the code works:

1. The `WebApplicationBuilder` class is used to create a web application builder.
2. The `Build()` method is used to build the web application.
3. The `MapGet()` method is used to map a GET request to the root URL ("/") to a lambda expression that returns an empty string.
4. The `Run()` method is used to start the web application.
